This game is a classic and a ton of fun to design. This app was built as part of my course work for Suncoast Developers Guild. The key objectives for this project were

Create the app using React.
Use an API to create the basic game logic.
I also used emojis to create the bomb and flag icons for the game.

Enjoy!
